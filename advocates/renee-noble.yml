  ## Bio
  Renee is the Regional Cloud Advocate for the Sydney Reactor and the Australia region. She's passionate about technology, education, community, and bringing them all together in-person and online.

She spends her spare time leading the Girls' Programming Network to support women and girls around Australia to get into coding with engaging tech education. She also teaches CS in a high school and runs her own business, ConnectEd Code, working to bring exciting coding opportunities to kids and teachers.
