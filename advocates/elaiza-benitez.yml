  ## Bio
  üëãüèª Hi, I'm Elaiza, and I have a passion for helping the technical community work with the Power Platform to build solutions. 

  üíª Prior to joining Microsoft, I was a Microsoft MVP for 11 years. Working as a solution architect and consultant on enterprise implementations, I was privileged to be involved with the Power Platform's evolution, helping shape and transform the way that customers build and deliver software together. I've also written many community tools over the years such as the Ribbon Workbench.

  üòä You can see me speaking at conferences around the globe, or on my YouTube channel. I also co-host the [XrmToolCast](https://xrmtoolcast.libsyn.com/), a podcast that covers all topics related to Power Platform development!

  üåÑ When I'm not coding games using Power Fx in my spare time, I love the outdoors, running, hiking, and skiing with my family.
