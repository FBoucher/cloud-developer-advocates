  ## Bio
  Hello | Kia Ora 🇳🇿 | Kamusta 🇵🇭
  
  I'm Elaiza 👋 
  
  I have a ✨passion✨ for helping the technical community build solutions with Microsoft Power Platform. I started with Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 and then fell in love with Power Platform in 2018. 

  Prior to joining Microsoft, I was a Microsoft MVP for 6 years in a row. I was a consultant working on implementation projects with Dynamics 365 and/or Power Platform.

  I often speak at online virtual events or in-person events. I also have a series on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ElaizaBenitez) called WTF - What The Flow where I help others learn about cloud flows.

  When I'm not experimenting with the Power Platform, you can find me making delicious meals 🍽️ or hanging out with my family 😊
