  ## Bio
  üëãüèª Hi! I'm Pamela Fox, a human that loves to learn, teach, and create.
  I love being a Cloud Developer Advocate because I get to do all three at once!

  üßëüèº‚Äçüè´ On the teaching front, I've taught computer science at UC Berkeley and volunteered in bay area classrooms
  as part of the TEALS, GirlsWhoCode, and CoderDojo organizations.
  I also started the SF chapter of GirlDevelopIt, where I taught dozens of web development workshops.

  üíª I've been in the tech industry for 15 years now, starting with my first role at Google
  as one of their first developer advocates. I went on to be an early full-stack engineer at Coursera
  and spent many years after at Khan Academy, both as an engineer and the creator of the computer programming content.

  üêõ I love watching caterpillars morph from one instar to another, until they finally (hopefully) turn into butterflies. ü¶ã
