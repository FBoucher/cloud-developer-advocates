  ## Bio
  Hey, I'm Joshua! A Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, a former Microsoft MVP, and an ex-SRE at Stack Overflow. At the moment, I'm focused on containers, securing software supply chains, and writing as much code in golang as possible. In my free time I enjoy reading (mostly non-fiction), lifting heavy things, and spending time with my wife and kids.
