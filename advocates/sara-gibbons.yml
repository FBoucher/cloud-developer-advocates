  ## Bio
  Born in raised in southeast Michigan, at 16 I got a part-time job and a loan from a bank to buy my first PC. A brand-new Windows 95, MS-DOS, Packard Bell magical machine that I had no idea how to use. Two years later (after paying for several ginormous AOL bills), I was packing it up and heading off to college after locking in enough scholarships and student loans to get me through a 4-year Actuarial Science degree. 
  
  Thanks to a friend who said, “Hey, you are good at math can you take this C++ class with me to help me pass?” I loved it and had my major changed to Information Systems by the end of the semester. I’ve since had an incredible software engineering career across many tech stacks, industries, from small start-ups to large enterprises.
  
  Through my career I've found my passions in building teams, utilizing the best tools and tech to solve problems, DEI and building communities. Outside of work I filled these passions by volunteering to teach underrepresented groups to code, created Girls Who Code clubs, worked with school districts to develop CS offerings, and speaking at tech conferences.
  
  When not working or volunteering you can find me cooking, baking, joining any 5k I can, building furniture, and enjoying the freshwater lake life with my husband and 4 kids.
