  ## Bio
  I'm a developer advocate at Microsoft, focusing on Azure ML. I'm interested
  in machine learning in general, and in the intersection of
  Applied Math and ML in particular.

  Prior to this role, I've worked on the WPF and Silverlight product teams at
  Microsoft, and as an independent consultant for those technologies.

  I absolutely love traveling and, together with my husband, have explored
  more than 65 countries.
