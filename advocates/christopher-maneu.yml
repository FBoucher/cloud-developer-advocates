  ## Bio
  Christopher is a Cloud engineer & Data engineering advocate at Microsoft. His mission is to help every technologist on the planet succeed, focusing on data and data team behind the applications.

  Before joining Azure Engineering, Christopher helped large corporations and startups creating user-friendly apps & services and helping build teams behind these services. He used to be an engineering lead at [Deezer.com](https://www.deezer.com), a worldwide music streaming service.
