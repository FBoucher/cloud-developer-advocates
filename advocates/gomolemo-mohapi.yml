  ## Bio
  Gomolemo is a young South African who is determined to make a long-lasting impact on the world through technology. 
  
  In university, he took it upon himself to create multiple written programming tutorials for his peers which significantly assisted those who were struggling to grasp programming concepts. Thereafter, Gomolemo joined the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program where he gained advanced technical skills and eventually expanded to host workshops, hackathons and speaking at various conferences.
  
  Gomolemo eventually fell in love with the Power Platform, because it was a low-code platform which gave way for him to empower and upskill not just those with a technical background, but anyone from any industry who was looking to learn how to build applications.
  
  He has since co-authored a Power Platform Udacity course and is now a Cloud Advocate at Microsoft focused on Power Apps and Fusion Development.
