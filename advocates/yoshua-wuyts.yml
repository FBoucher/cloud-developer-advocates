  ## Bio

  Yosh is a developer advocate at Microsoft for the Rust programming language, based
  in Copenhagen, Denmark. They've spent their career working on public projects,
  starting in Node.js but gradually moving to doing more in Rust until that became
  their primary focus.

  They keep [a blog](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com) where they write about designing
  the Rust language and libraries, and occasionally they make videos on programming and
  Rust specifically. When they're not working they love to cook (and tweet about said
  cooking), and goof off with their two (extremely cute) cats.

  ## Office Hours

  Yosh is always happy to grab a coffee and chat about Rust, programming
  languages, or tech in general. Times available are generally between 10:00 and
  17:00 CET/CEST. Contact them via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoshuawuyts).

  ## Notable Projects

  - [Choo](https://choo.io) - A minimal JavaScript frontend framework.
  - [async-std](https://async.rs) - A full reimplementation of the Rust stdlib using async Rust.
  - [Tide](https://docs.rs/tide) - A pragmatic web framework built for async Rust.
